# Jon-Stoll-Portfolio

## Description

For this project, I will be creating a mobile responsive portfolio using Bootstrap's built in CSS and JavaScript functionality. The reason for using Bootstrap is simple. It allows developers to easily build the backbone to their site in a fraction of the time it would normally take. In addition, if one finds themselves wanting to change any detail to the already existing CSS, they can quickly link their own external stylesheet to the doc in order to build on top of what Bootstrap has already provided. 

I will be tackling three main components while building this portfolio:

1) Utilizing Bootrap's grid system to structure the site in a readable and visually asthetic way.
2) Developing an functinoal navbar that takes the user from one page to the next.
3) Making the website and images responsive to various types of media screen sizes.
