# Jon-Stoll-Portfolio

## Description

For this project, I will be creating a mobile responsive portfolio using Bootstrap's built in CSS and JavaScript functionality. The reason for using Bootstrap is simple - It allows developers to easily build the backbone to their site in a fraction of the time it would normally take. In addition, if one finds themselves wanting to change any detail to the already existing CSS, they can quickly link their own external stylesheet to the doc in order to build on top of what Bootstrap has already provided. 

I will be tackling three main components while building this portfolio:

1) Utilizing Bootrap's grid system to structure the site in a readable and visually asthetic way.
2) Developing an functinoal navbar that takes the user from one page to the next.
3) Making the website and images responsive to various types of media screen sizes.

Throughout this project, I learned the importance of reading documentation for each of the key components I was adding to my site. Because Bootstrap has such a wide range of functionality, it is important to know exactly how each css class is built, and what specifically each of them do. Without proper understanding, tt is common for one class you're using to to override another. The use of Bootstrap's grid system was extremely helpful in attaining a ordered system that spaces each element apart at the parameters of the user's choosing. On top of Bootstrap's grid system, they provide easy to use container classes that allow for fluid responsiveness between screen sizes. Additionally, Bootstrap's built in navbar functions allow the user to build customized navbars that can toggle between a collapsed and uncollapsed version.
